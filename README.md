# Ripple-Effects
## Instructions

Our study aims to quantify the "ripple effects" of awards on the impact of papers by prizewinners and their collaborators, and the ripple chain along the collaboration network.

### Prerequisites

To run the analysis, ensure the following:

1. **Python 3.11** and **RStudio 4** is installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries by running the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas json numpy matplotlib seaborn collections
3. Navigate to each Jupyter notebook and run the cells sequentially. The code will generate the necessary results and 
   visualizations for the ripple effects analysis.
